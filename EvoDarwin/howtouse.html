        <h1>How to use</h1>
        <p>So, you've gotten everything downloaded, extracted, and running, so now what?</p>
        <p>Getting a population started is really simple- just click on the "Populate" button, and six new creatures will pop up in the main display.</p>
        <div class="help-inlineimages">
            <img src="htu-1.png" class="guide-image" />
        </div>
        <p>There are a few more buttons to point out here. After populating, you can step to the next generation by clicking "Step >"</p>
        <div class="help-inlineimages">
            <img src="htu-2.png" class="guide-image" />
        </div>
        <p>When proceding to a new generation, pre-existing creatures can decide to mate and create offspring, as shown above. Offspring tend to have an attractiveness not too far off from their parents, and they also get one of their parent's name, usually the male's.</p>
        <p>That's the basics down. Now for some extra stuff. Look at the text at the top-left corner of the main panel.</p>
        <div class="help-inlineimages">
            <img src="htu-3.png" class="guide-image" />
        </div>
        <p>These are some stats about the current population.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gen = Generation</li>
            <li>Pop = Population</li>
            <li>GDSPC = Average attract value (Gross Domestic Sexiness Per Capita)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Looking back at the buttons, we notice that there are three buttons on the bottom row.</p>
        <div class="help-inlineimages">
            <img src="htu-4.png" class="guide-image" />
        </div>
        <p>As you would expect, these buttons sort the creatures by a certain value. This is useful for finding the most/least attractive creature, finding a creature by name, or making predictions for future generations.</p>
        <p>If you want to start a new population, you can click the "Kill All" button to, you guessed it, kill off all of the creatures.</p>
        <div class="help-inlineimages">
            <img src="htu-5.png" class="guide-image" />
        </div>
        <p>That's pretty much it. Simple, right? With this guide out of the way, feel free to tinker around with different populations and look at how each creature interacts with each other.</p>
