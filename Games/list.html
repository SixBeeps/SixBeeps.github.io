            <h3>Where did you learn to make games?</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">When I was young (~11 years old) I was enrolled in a place called <a href="https://www.game-u.com">Game-U</a>, which is an after-school program that is taught by industry-trained game developers. Originally, it was pretty small, but after a year or so, I watched as it grew and grew into what it is now. I was even employed there when I became 16.</p>
